## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Search for GitHub users by their username
- See relevant user information based on their search
- Switch between light and dark themes
- **Bonus**: Have the correct color scheme chosen for them based on their computer preferences. _Hint_: Research `prefers-color-scheme` in CSS.

### Screenshot

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My process
  This will be my first solo project, so please forgive me for not following proper processes

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Vanilla Js


### What I learned

-Exntensive use of flexbox. This project may be small but the high in the usuage of flexbox

-Api. I used this project as an opportunity to learn working with apis

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:




### Continued development

I intend to use SASS in any new projects and increase my api and js usuage. Also learn a framework library, preferably React.
